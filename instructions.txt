first of all go to the Create_dataset_from_webcam.py file then take some 1000 images for each person you want. the images will be stored in folders 0 , 1 (you can add more if you want more than 2 people) . just remember to make changes in the folder name in the Create_dataset_from_webcam.py file each time you take images of new person. you can quit taking images by pressing 'q'.
second , run the faceRecognition.py file . it has all the functions which will be called during the testing.
third, run the resizeImages.py . it will resize all the images in the  0 , 1 and so on sub folders inside the training folder. it will resize them to 100*100 pixels.
fourth, run the test.py file and wait for some time. once done , you will see a rectangle on the face image fed for test. remember to put that image in the TestImages folder.
finally, run the  	videoTester.py file. you can see your faces detected. the faces in the folders 0 , 1,... will be recognized.
